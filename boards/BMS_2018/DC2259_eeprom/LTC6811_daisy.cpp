  ltc6811-1 Multicell Battery Monitor
@verbatim
  The ltc6811 is a 3rd generation multicell battery stack
  monitor that measures up to 12 series connected battery
  cells with a total measurement error of less than 1.2mV. The
  cell measurement range of 0V to 5V makes the ltc6811
  suitable for most battery chemistries. All 12 cell voltages
  can be captured in 290uS, and lower data acquisition rates
  can be selected for high noise reduction.

  Using the ltc6811-1, multiple devices are connected in
  a daisy-chain with one host processor connection for all
  devices.
